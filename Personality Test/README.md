#Personality Test

The Keirsey test measures four independent dimensions of personality:
Extrovert versus Introvert (E vs I): what energizes you
Sensation versus iNtuition (S vs N): what you focus on
Thinking versus Feeling (T vs F): how you interpret what you focus on
Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P): how you approach life
Individuals are categorized as being on one side or the other of each of these dimensions.  
The corresponding letters are put together to form a personality type. 
For example, if you are an extravert, intuitive, thinking, perceiving 
person then you are referred to as an ENTP.
This program will take people's Keirsey test answers to determine their
personality type based on the four dimensions. Takes answer from given input
file and writes results to a given output file.
