# GPA Calculator

This program will determine your overall GPA by calculating your
current GPA and your current classes, with estimated outcome
and credit amount.

# Note to Self: try to expand this idea by creating a python script
# to scrape the information from UW Catalog, and be able just to input
# course ID like EE215 and CSE414.
