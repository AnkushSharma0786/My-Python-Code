#Django

* Working on learning Django through tutorials
* Polls App
	* Need to finish Search Bar set up:

	* DIRS is a list of filesystem directories to check when loading Django templates; itâ€™s a search path.

	* Now create a directory called admin inside templates, and copy the template admin/base_site.html from within the default Django admin template directory in the source code of Django itself (django/contrib/admin/templates) into that directory.
