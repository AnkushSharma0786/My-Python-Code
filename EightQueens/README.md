# Eight Queens

Welcome to EightQueens where there are 8 queens on the a board,
and identifies if queens are able to attack each other or not.
If queens are able to attack each other, the board has a feature
where you can reposition all queens so they are free from danger (recursive back-tracking).
Other options include removing and adding queens as well as changing
the default board size (8 by 8) into an n by n (anything above 0).
